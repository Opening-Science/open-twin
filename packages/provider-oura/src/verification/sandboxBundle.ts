/**
 * The recorded Oura sandbox capture, driven all the way to a Bundle.
 *
 * `exampleBundle` next to this file is built from payloads written while writing the
 * mappers, and it covers six of the thirteen scopes Oura serves. That is the shape of
 * gap this exists to close: a fixture authored from the same understanding as the code
 * agrees with the code whether or not the understanding is right, and a scope no
 * fixture exercises is a scope no gate has ever looked at.
 *
 * Both halves were already tested and never joined. `sandboxFixture.unit.test.ts` runs
 * the capture through the connector's schemas but stops there; `exampleBundle` runs
 * hand-written payloads through the mappers. Nothing ran real vendor data through the
 * mappers, and two defects lived in that seam until it was closed:
 *
 *   - six extensions were emitted and never declared, so the validator rejected them
 *     36 times over. The declarations mechanism was built precisely to make an
 *     undeclared extension fail the build, but it only ever saw the six scopes the
 *     exemplar requested.
 *   - every Observation referenced a Patient that was not in the bundle, because the
 *     sandbox returns 404 for `personal_info` and nothing supplied one in its place.
 *
 * `personal_info` is absent here for that reason, which makes this the fixture that
 * holds the synthesised Patient in place: if `minimalPatient` stops being emitted, the
 * validator reports an unresolved URN reference for every Observation in this bundle.
 *
 * See fixtures/PROVENANCE.md for what the capture is and what it is not.
