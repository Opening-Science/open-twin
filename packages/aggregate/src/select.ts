 * Choosing between two connectors that measured the same thing.

 * The rule is an evidence lookup, not a preference order. `reliability.ts` records
 * what the validation literature says about a (source, measure) pair, and this reads
 * it — so "Oura is best for sleep" is never assumed, and is in fact wrong as stated:
 * Oura is good at separating sleep from wake and only fair at staging it, and those
 * are different measures with different answers.
 *
 * The most important outcome here is the refusal. Energy expenditure has a published
 * mean absolute percentage error above 30% on every brand tested, so there is no good
 * source to pick — and naming a winner would present a confidence nobody has earned.
 * Where the evidence says no source is dependable, every reading is kept and no
 * derived value is asserted at all.
