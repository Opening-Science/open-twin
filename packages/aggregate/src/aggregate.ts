/**
 * One bundle from several connectors, with overlaps reconciled and nothing discarded.
 *
 * Two rules hold this together, and both are about not destroying evidence:
 *
 *   1. Every source Observation survives. A reconciliation is an added assertion, not
 *      a replacement, so changing the selection policy later is a re-run over data
 *      already held rather than a re-fetch from vendors who may no longer serve it.
 *   2. Where the evidence gives no basis to prefer a source, none is preferred. The
 *      output then says several sources disagreed and no more, which is the truth.
 *
 * The derived Observation carries `derivedFrom` pointing at every source it considered
 * — not only the winner — and `method` carrying the policy in readable prose. A
 * selection nobody can audit is indistinguishable from a guess.
