 * Which validated measure an Observation is an instance of.
 *
 * `reliability.ts` grades a (source, measure) pair, and its central finding is that
 * accuracy is per-measure and not per-device: every consumer wearable separates sleep
 * from wake well and stages sleep badly. To act on that at all, something has to say
 * which measure a given Observation is — and a LOINC code alone does not, because two
 * codes can name the same measured thing and one code can be reached by two connectors
 * that are not equally good at it.
 *
 * The mapping is deliberately narrow. An Observation whose code is absent here is
 * simply not reconciled: it is carried through untouched, which is the honest outcome
 * for a measure nobody has published validation evidence about.
