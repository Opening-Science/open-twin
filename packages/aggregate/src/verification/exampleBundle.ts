/**
 * Two connectors describing one night and one day, reconciled, for the HL7 validator.
 *
 * The point of validating this one is the resource the other bundles do not have: a
 * derived Observation carrying `derivedFrom` into resources in the same bundle and a
 * `method` under an open-twin CodeSystem. Both are the kind of thing that validates in
 * the abstract and fails in a bundle — a `derivedFrom` reference has to resolve, and an
 * undeclared CodeSystem is exactly what the conformance stage exists to catch.
 *
 * It carries the two outcomes that matter, side by side:
 *
 *   - sleep duration is reconciled and a derived Observation is emitted;
 *   - energy expenditure is not, because no source is dependable for it, so the two
 *     readings stand and nothing is asserted over them.
