/**
 * The bundle registered in `verify/bundles.manifest.ts` and handed to the HL7
 * validator in CI.
 *
 * It is the output of this package's own normaliser run over real foreign input —
 * three vital-sign Observations HL7 publishes as examples, unaltered — rather than a
 * literal written to please the validator. A hand-written fixture would prove that
 * someone can write conformant JSON; this proves that the code path callers actually
 * use produces it.
 *
 * The input is genuinely hostile in the way real input is: every `subject` is
 * `Patient/example`, which is the precise defect decision D1 exists to end, and no
 * Patient is in the bundle at all. All three entries carry
 * `meta.profile: vitalsigns`, so the validator enforces the vital-signs profile on
 * the output and the normaliser cannot get away with a bundle that merely parses.
 *
 * No `subject` is supplied, so D1's `urn:uuid:` fallback applies and a minimal
 * Patient is added. That is the harder case, and the one where the bundle has to stay
 * internally resolvable without anyone asserting an identity.
