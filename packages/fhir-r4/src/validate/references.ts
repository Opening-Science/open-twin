/**
 * Reference resolution *inside* a bundle.
 *
 * The severities differ by reference form, because the forms make different
 * promises. A `urn:uuid:` reference is only meaningful inside the bundle that
 * carries the matching `fullUrl` — nothing on the receiving server can resolve it —
 * so a dangling one is reported. A relative `Type/id` reference may legitimately
 * point at a resource the receiver already holds, so its absence from the bundle is
 * information, not a defect; reporting it as one would fail almost every real-world
 * collection bundle.
 *
 * The dangling URN is a **warning**, not an error, and that is not this package's
 * judgement: the HL7 reference validator reports exactly one line for it,
 * `Warning - URN reference is not locally contained within the bundle`, and where the
 * two disagree the validator is right. `normaliseBundle` treats the same finding as
 * blocking, because it rewrites the entire reference graph and cannot rewrite a
 * reference that points nowhere — a stricter local rule, applied where it belongs
 * and not smuggled into a conformance report.
 *
 * `bundleType` carries `Bundle.type` because one reference form is legal in exactly
 * one kind of bundle. R4 http.html, *Conditional References*: in a transaction, and
 * only in a transaction, a reference may be replaced by a search URI describing how
 * to find the target. The server executing the transaction runs the search and
 * substitutes the result; zero matches or more than one fails the transaction. So a
 * `Type?query` outside a transaction is genuinely malformed — there is nothing there
 * to execute it — and inside one it is conformant and unresolvable here, which is the
 * same shape as an external reference and gets the same severity.
 *
 * Omitting `bundleType` means "not inside a bundle at all", which is not a
 * transaction either — that is the standalone-resource call in `validate.ts`, the
 * one that also passes an empty index.
