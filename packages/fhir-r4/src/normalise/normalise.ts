 * Findings that must not stop normalisation.

 * Two different reasons, and they should not be confused:
 *
 *  - The addressing rules (`ot-fullurl-*`, `bdl-8`) are what normalisation exists to
 *    repair. Refusing to normalise a bundle because its fullUrls are wrong would be
 *    refusing to do the job.
 *  - The unit-policy rules are the opposite case: they are *not* repaired, because
 *    repairing them would mean rewriting a number or a code, and this function does
 *    not do that under any circumstances. They are carried through to the caller
 *    unchanged, attached to the normalised bundle, for a human to decide about.
 *
 * Everything else that is an error stops the process. Normalising a bundle that
 * violates obs-6, or that carries a dangling `urn:uuid:` reference, would produce a
 * tidy-looking bundle that is still wrong — and now with open-twin's provenance tag
 * on it, which makes it this project's problem rather than the sender's.
